## :bookmark: About

Prove of concept of a survey application where each vote has a different weight depending on selected criteria. This way the result of the survey would be determined not only by the number of the voters, but also by their characteristics.

A simple example would be a survey created by a Twitch streamer with different weight for subscribers and non-subscribers.
